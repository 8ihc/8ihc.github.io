                <h1>In Loving Memory</h1>
                <p>
                    In the gentle embrace of March 2025, we bid farewell to a beloved companion who brought boundless joy and
                    unconditional love into our lives. Your paw prints left indelible marks on our hearts, and though
                    you're no longer physically beside us, your spirit continues to guide our path.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every morning walk we shared, every playful moment in the nature, and every quiet evening spent
                    together created memories that will forever remain treasured. Your loyal friendship taught us the
                    purest form of love, and your courage in facing life's challenges inspired us to be better beings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though the house feels quieter now without the gentle tap of your paws or the warmth of your
                    presence, we find comfort in knowing that you lived a life filled with love, adventure, and
                    happiness. Your legacy lives on in the countless lives you touched and the hearts you warmed with
                    your presence.
